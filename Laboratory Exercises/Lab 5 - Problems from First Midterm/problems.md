## Problem 1
Half of a silver fir can be drawn using asterisks * and vertical bars |.
An example of how it should look is provided in the code. 

Basically, the first line is an asterisk, then the line after is a vertical bar.
Afterwards, the next lines alternate between a vertical bar by itself and a vertical bar followed by asterisks,
with each bar having one more asterisk than the last.
The silver fir ends on a line that has a vertical bar and N asterisks. \
For a given N, print the silver fir like the description. 

The silver fir example in the code is what it looks like when N = 4.
## Problem 2
A given rectangle is located in the first quadrant of the coordinate system
and its sides are parallel to the axes.
The rectangle is defined by the coordinates of the lower-left and upper-right points
(labelled A and C, respectively) which are whole numbers. Then, the coordinates of two points are read. \
The program must print "DA" (yes) if the point lies on the sides of the rectangle, 
or "NE" (no) if it's inside or outside the rectangle.
## Problem 3
A sentence or a string of words are read from user input until the user enters a period.
Create a program that will print those same words on screen, with the difference being
that for every instance of two consonants next to each other, they will swap places. 

*Note: it is assumed that there are no words with more than two sequential consonants.*
