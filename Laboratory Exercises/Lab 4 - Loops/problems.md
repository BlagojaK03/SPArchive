## Problem 1
Write a program that will print the sum of all numbers that are divisible by 3
in the range [A, B). A and B are read from user input.

Example: \
Let A = 10 and B = 20. The range would be 10-19. Of those numbers, the numbers divisible
by 3 are 12, 15 and 18, and their sum is 45.
## Problem 2
From standard input read the value of a number N, then N whole numbers. \
Print the biggest difference between two consecutive numbers on screen. \
Solve without using an array!

Example: \
Let N = 5 and the subsequent numbers be 1, 3, 0, 5 and 2. The differences are as follows:
- 3-1 = 2
- 0-3 = -3
- 5-0 = 5
- 2-5 = -3 \
The biggest difference is 5.
## Problem 3
Read whole numbers from user input until the user inputs something that isn't a whole number. \
Print the sum of the numbers whose digits are arranged in descending order on screen.
If there are no such numbers, print a message that says there are none.
