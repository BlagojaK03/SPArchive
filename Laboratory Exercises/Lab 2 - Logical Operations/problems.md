## Problem 1
A number X is read from standard input. \
If the number x exists in the range (-100,100) or [200,300), print 1 (true). Otherwise, print 0 (false). \
The problem needs to be solved with logical operations (no if-else).
## Problem 2 
Write a program where, from keyboard input, an amount of money in a user's transaction account is read. \
In the next line, five more amounts are read. These represent deposits and withdrawals. \
If the user still has money in their account after the transactions, print 1. Else, print 0.
## Problem 3
From standard input, the following data is read for a student in FCSE:
- Index (6-digit whole number)
- Six grades from their last semester (5 being the lowest, 10 the highest) 

Write a program where the following information about the student will be printed out to the standard output:
- The student's grade average, rounded to 3 decimal points
- Year of study
  - In this case, if a student's index starts with 22, then they are first year. If the index starts with 21 they are second year, 20 for third year, and so on
- If the student got an award (1 - true, 0 - false)
  - The student is awarded if their grade average is at least 9.5
